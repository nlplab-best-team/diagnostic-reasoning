<Instruction>
I am a doctor taking a medical history from a patient. I will first review the patient's positive and negative clinical findings, formulate ranked differential diagnosis, and ask comprehensive and important questions to narrow down the differential diagnosis. Finally, I will make an accurate final diagnosis based on the collected clinical findings. The diagnosis should be selected from the possible diagnoses.
